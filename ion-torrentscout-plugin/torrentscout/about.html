Torrent Scout Light is a Web based interactive tool, which provides users access to raw data generated by the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine(TM). 
It allows users to navigate and view data all the way from the raw signal to the final alignment. 
Torrent Scout Light is based on the Google Web Toolkit and VAADIN/Java. 
It uses the Torrent Scout application as a library on the server side.

Functionality includes:
<ul>
<li>Viewing ionograms and alignments</li>
<li>Viewing raw traces of multiple flows of one well, and also of multiple wells and one flow</li>
<li>Export both raw and NN subtracted data of one of multiple flows, and of an entire area on the chip (optionally filtered by a mask)</li>
<li>Find reads based on alignment (indels for instance), both via the interactive plugin (suggested if you are running multiple searches), and also via the TSL application</li>
<li>Load and save your searches (stored as heat maps)</li>
<li>Find/filter reads based on scores (such as % identity, Q lengths etc)</li>
<li>Compute the mean signal of an area of multiple flows</li>
<li>Find reads based on genome position</li>
<li>Calculate your own masks using the dropdown and command line mask calculator (allows saving/loading of masks)</li>
<li>Compute your own masks based on the raw data and using various histogram functions</li>
</ul>
