Main Changes for 2.2.1:
========================
- fixed too many open files related to exporting alignments
- removing old TSL/torrentscout folder in postinst (otherwise war may not deploy correctly)
- changed description, contact person

Main Changes from 2.1.4:
========================
- export in a separate thread
- export ionograms, alignments and raw data

Main Changes from 0.2.1 to 1.2.2:
=================================
- fixed unecessary SAM error msg
- fixed problem with hard clipping (CIGAR)
- more error tolerance
- only show TSL link
- increased speed significantly (several fold)
- fixed several too many open files problems on Proton experiments
- reduced (debug) log output
- link to help doc from plugin results page
- performance logging and display (memory, cpu)
- instance.html to compute alignment searches via crunchers
- added about.html with summary and link to documentation
 
TSL improvements:
- fixed horizontal stripes issue in process view
- simplified and compacted gui components
- use of more threads to avoid hanging client
- find reads by scores (such as % identity, nr of indels etc)
- find reads by genome position
- added help to each component
- added overall help
- much better file browser (much faster, also works in cases where there are thousands of files)
- link to help pdf doc
- alignment pattern search
- saving/loading search results and masks
- heat map gradient legend and computation of density in 9 areas

Main Changes from 0.2.0 to 0.2.1:
=================================
- fixed link from plugin to TSL so that it works both inside and outside network
- fixed an error msg caused by a new Cigar element
- TSL link accessible directly in the results page (with _block.html)
- fixed a problem that sometimes occurred with the new "skipping regions" format
- fixed hash key generation: on different system the key was different resulting in recreation of index files
- for proton runs, tomcat needs more memory (changed to a max of 6 GB) (or else it fails when generating heat maps)

TSL improvements:
- simplifications: experiment opens without single click when launched from plugin page
- ionogram includes raw nn subtracted traces
