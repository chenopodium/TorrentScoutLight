To build the debian package for release:

 

1.    Change into directory ./TorrentScoutLight/ion-torrentscout-light

2.    Edit version file to update the RELEASE number; typically increment by 1.

3.    Execute ./build-deb.sh.  You will be thrown into an editor to add a comment to the ChangeLog file.  Make an appropriate entry and save.

4.    Change to parent directory (./TorrentScoutLight)

5.  Upload the new deb file to internal apt repository: ../TS/buildTools/publish <new deb file>

6.  Commit to svn the edited version file and the ChangeLog file.

sudo dpkg --install ion-torrentscout-light-2.3.0.deb
