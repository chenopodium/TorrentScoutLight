vncserver -kill :97
rm -f /tmp/X97-lock
rm -f /tmp/X11-unix/X97
vncserver :97 -geometry 1900x1200 -depth 24 &


To run TorrentScout via VNC (say on display 55)


vncserver :11 -geometry 1600x1200 -depth 24 &
vncserver :55 -geometry 1600x1200 -depth 24 &
vncserver :77 -geometry 1600x1200 -depth 24 &
vncserver :88 -geometry 1600x1200 -depth 24 &

1. start a vnc server on rnd1 as ionadmin

Example for rnd1.ite:5955
vncserver :55 -geometry 1600x1200 -depth 24 &

(I may have already started one that you can use!)

(To set the password: vncserver /.vnc/passwd)

2. To check if it is running:
ps -eaf | grep vnc (and then check for your port number)

3. To clean up VNC (in case vnc stopped for some reason but didn't do so completely)


rm /tmp/.X11-lock
rm /tmp/.X11-unix/X11


rm /tmp/X55-lock
rm /tmp/X11-unix/X55

3.a) to Kill it gracefully: vncserver -kill :55

4. To connect to it from any client machine via ultra vnc:

rnd1.ite:5955

Password as specfied in the /.vnc/passwd
(vncserver /.vnc/passwd)

5. To make copy paste work from unix to Windows via vnc:

a) log into rnd1 via VNC client as above
b) open a terminal window via the same VNC client session
c) type: autocutsel -s PRIMARY -fork
d) after that, copy/paste from unix to Windows should work.

6. To Start Torrent Scout on rnd1

a) open a terminal
b) type ./torrentscout.sh (for the currently officially deployed version)
   type ./runtomcat.sh (for my *test* version, which may or mah not work :-)

Please let me know if you have any questions :-)

Best wishes,
